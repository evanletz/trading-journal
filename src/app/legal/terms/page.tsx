          <strong>Termination/Access Restriction</strong>

        <br></br>
        <p>
          Dev 22 LLC reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate
          your access to the Site and the related services or any portion
          thereof at any time, without notice. To the maximum extent permitted
          by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of
          Pennsylvania and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and
          venue of courts in Pennsylvania in all disputes arising out of or
          relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized in
          any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these
          Terms, including, without limitation, this section.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency
          relationship exists between you and Dev 22 LLC as a result of this
          agreement or use of the Site. Dev 22 LLC's performance of this
          agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing
          contained in this agreement is in derogation of Dev 22 LLC's right to
          comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or
          requirements relating to your use of the Site or information provided
          to or gathered by Dev 22 LLC with respect to such use. If any part of
          this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant
          to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty
          disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the
          invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a
          valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of
          the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall
          continue in effect.

          Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the

          Site and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and
          proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between the user and
          Dev 22 LLC with respect to the Site. A printed version of this
          agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be
          admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or
          relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same
          conditions as other business documents and records originally
          generated and maintained in printed form. It is the express wish to
          the parties that this agreement and all related documents be written
